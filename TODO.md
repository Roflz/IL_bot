## 🔄 In Progress

### Live Features Table Display
- Fix the live features table display issues - table structure exists but rows not showing properly
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS - Mapping service now working correctly, need to verify GUI display

## ⏳ Pending

### Table Enhancement Features
- Fix alternating row logic in _refresh_table method
- Debug data format being passed to live features view
- Test that table updates work correctly with 10-second interval

## 📋 Summary of Recent Fixes

### Mapping Service Issues Resolved:
1. **Reverse Map Building Bug**: Fixed `_build_reverse_map()` method that was incorrectly mapping values
2. **Global Hash Mappings**: Fixed `_create_reverse_lookups()` to properly process `Global.hash_mappings`
3. **Live Mappings Merge**: Ensured live mappings properly override training mappings
4. **Debug Logging**: Cleaned up excessive debug logging while maintaining essential functionality

### Current Status:
- ✅ ID mappings are being generated and saved correctly to `data/05_mappings/live_id_mappings.json`
- ✅ Mapping service is loading and merging live mappings with training data
- ✅ Reverse lookups are being created correctly for all mapping types
- ✅ Translations are working for both training and live hash values
- 🔄 Need to verify that the GUI is displaying the translated values correctly

### Next Steps:
1. Verify that the Live Features tab in the GUI shows translated values (e.g., "Walk here" instead of "53327")
2. Test that the translations toggle works correctly
3. Ensure the table updates are working with the 10-second interval
4. Fix any remaining display issues in the table
